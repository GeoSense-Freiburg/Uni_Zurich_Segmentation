# Uni Zurich plant species Segmentation in UAV images project

This repository contains code for generating masks for citizen science plant photographs. The generated masks together with photos will be used together with UAV based reference data to segment tree species in UAV images.
The repository is under development. 
Stay tuned for more updates!
